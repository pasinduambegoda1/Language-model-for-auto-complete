        "\n",
        "The core component of an auto-complete system is a language model, which assigns probabilities to word sequences. The goal is to determine the most likely next word based on previously typed words.  For example:\n",
        ">\"I have a pen\"\n",
        "is expected to have a higher probability than\n",
        ">\"I am a pen\"\n",
        "since the first one seems to be a more natural sentence in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can take advantage of this probability calculation to develop an auto-complete system.  \n",
        "For instance, if a user types\n",
        ">\"I eat scrambled\"\n",
        "Then you can find a word `x`  such that \"I eat scrambled x\" receives the highest probability.  If x = \"eggs\", the sentence would be\n",
        ">\"I eat scrambled eggs\"\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, you will implement an **N-gram language model**—a fundamental approach used in natural language processing (NLP). N-gram models analyze the probability of word sequences based on their occurrence in a given dataset. This method is widely used in applications such as **machine translation and speech recognition**.\n",
